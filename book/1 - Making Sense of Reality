1. What now?: The fate of humanity.
.
A What matters: Humanity and their fate. Let us suppose we are [humans] when this book was written, who want to discover how to act most logically in accordance with the truth, and [with a goal at all]. For such a goal, we need to know what humans desire. [Naturally], [human desires must fundamentally arise from the human body], (like [everything arises from what already is]). [The human body naturally and (ultimately) only impels humans to do actions that increase their presence] (viz. both space and timewise, collectively and individually). Thus, [(all) human goals must ultimately come from the want to maximize presence //A1A//], and by extension avoid the lack of it, [death //ABB//], ([abstractly so too]). In addition, bodily impulses (all towards which) are felt either positively or negatively until solved, placing those feelings, [happiness and suffering], as another ultimate human desire to solve [related to it //exact nature of mort//], ([happiness is actually the absence of suffering]). The need to suffer and die can be called the “plight of mortality”, and may with this be described as the (ultimately) only and universal human goal. That means what will minimize mortality the most, is [the most logical/natural human action].


A Discovering the best action: Going from general to specific. The action (for us humans) that minimizes human mortality the most can only be discovered by discerning it from reality with our given context in mind. This would, for us, involve going from general reality, into its effects on human mortality, and finally into how reality best be changed by means of humans. //because?
//integrate this with 2.? call 1+2 for "Human realization" 


//the human observer thing is so vital, haha


With that, everything concerning humans may be procedurally abstracted.




//”by means of humans” implies that the best option accounts for what is easiest / requires least effort, as opposed to reality just magically becoming perfect
//general reality part also defines what a human can change, for the later part? (along with 5.?)




//no idea what to do with [A1B] and [A2C]






2. Examining reality: A universal framework.
.
//boltzmann brain paradox would mean flucts cannot be infinite, or else we would be infinitely likely to be boltzmann brains?


//talk about how "reductionism" is only problematic when "information" is irrecoverably lost (e.g. you can simply and then unsimply it to get the same thing back)


//we have to establish that using anything but the universal framework (aside from asking the question and setting the rough goal), isn’t proper logic or w/e


//we'll bother with subtitles (haha) later


B1 Finding any truth with human observation: Assume patterns. For us to ascertain reality (to discover the best action for the human goal), all information about it would need to be funneled through our only method of observation, [human (bodies)]. Where [humans are imperfect sensers], meaning nothing can be known by them for certain. Accordingly, the “unabstracted truth” (viz. how reality actually functions) is unobtainable for humans. 
	Instead, humans (sc. [and everything else]) (in practice) assume what the different elements (and their functions) in their experience are. Such assumptions are imagined patterns (i.e. abstractions), meant to correspond to [(absolutely existing) real patterns of reality's workings //determinism//] (n.b. although often simplified to conserve energy). Here, since consistent correspondence can never be a "certain truth" (sc. as per human imperfect knowing, making this inherently probabilistic), if it is always corresponding (to a human perspective), it may be considered a "practical truth", (o. [common ones are our source of information]).
	So to discover the best action, we will need perfectly corresponding abstractions. Here, because [things are interconnected] //arbitrary!//, it is impossible to make any absolutely corresponding abstractions without all the information needed to generate the rest (i.e. lossless breviations). Where our reality is completely interconnected //arbitrary!//. //And so humans cannot accurately ascertain specifics, and can only figure out a uf or w/e


B2 Ascertaining unobserved truths: Continuing patterns. 


Not everything that may affect a human is immediately observable to them. But because it has to become observable at some point to affect an aware human (n.b. even if it is difficult to distinguish), it allows humans to [know] about it. 


Since humans cannot observe the entire truth of everything at once, humans need to use pattern-recognition to ascertain truths they cannot directly observe, [since patterns do exist, in an absolute sense //making the universe deterministic in practice//]. From here, [everything that can affect humans, is knowable] (viz. observable or inferable) //it is inferrable, even if very remote effects, most of physics is inferred, not observed//, although [not specifics //potential and the truth of in-system uncertainties//].


//reduce


B3 Ascertaining the whole truth: Using a universal framework. And to not incompletely reason by [missing information //rather than considering it uncertain//], which would increase inaccuracies, it is necessary to arrange a framework [in which any discrete occurrence may be predictable //in the sense that you can make our scenario from the ground up if you did the chimp writing thing with it//], a "universal framework". If our constructed reality within this framework then matches with our scenario, we will be able to know everything [general //specifics are caused by THE spur into chaos, and we cannot predict those, only go with that there was a discrete spur//]. //specifics are not important because?


//better define the uf: it is the sandbox simulator in which we may construct scenarios of our reality to accurately depict reality for analysis (since senses are unreliable)


//where we find later that there is only one path anyways, and that it is viable, so it is irrelevant what the odds actually are, since we’d go the same path anyways


//a main theme here is that we don’t know everything. but what we don’t know doesn’t affect us, so it doesn’t matter. (e.g. if ghosts affected us, we would see them even if there is nothing to physically perceive, just from there being a pattern). Thus, we discuss a bunch of things which are perhaps eternal uncertainties (without specifying contemporary ones?), just to show they don’t matter sort of, and then examining only the “normal” things which do matter. Hence this book becomes timeless?
//incl about other uncerts here?


B3 Basic certainties for the human observer's universal framework: Things, interaction by relativity, attraction, four dimensions, continuity, fluctuations, linear time, consciousness. Any framework is a set of basic certainties which may be extrapolated from: Fundamentally, the existence of "reality", containing at least one "universe", can reliably be assumed. Within the universe, there appears to be a "spacetime (i.e. 4D) continuum" (viz. an area where things can exist both spatially and timewise). In which, there appears to be a difference between something and nothing (i.e. matter and vacuum), these things having consistent behaviors with each other, following different preferences (i.e. attractions), [which leads to discernable patterns]. And it appears that time flows in only one direction, and that no changes are realized without following it. Where the advancement of time can be discerned from the [fluctuations] it brings affecting things. And it appears our method of observation is from a seemingly discrete point in spacetime, which also heeds linear time. None of these fundamentals (as laws) are known to be changed [B2B].
//elaborate on relativity in interactipns (potential)




//this goes into the next one too? //we intro 3. with discussing the uf from a human perspective, and that these basics only exist from a human perspective (along with other noninteractive stuff like consciousness)
//infinity [B2A] //establish "information" here? (information is what allows big scale interacting systems to happen)
//interaction appears to be through a what an be described as a field-model, which would mean more information is “created” (becomes relevant) when things get close to each other


//we use the practicsl truths to be compared with the uf scenario to look for discrepacies, and thereby validate it




//basic uncertainties
//everything we cannot sense in any way (absolutely so), does not affect us, and so is irrelevant
//while everything else that is uncertain, either can be assumed to be a certain way (because if fits uf), or we cannot do anything about (since we can only affect the internals of our system, since the universe is a closed/isolated system or w/e)
//the “true” “limits” of uf
//ideas:
- true nature of everything, we can only assume the shadows are correct, not knowing whether there is a fire (as explained earlier) (don’t need to include this, really, if we have that)
- the true nature of time
- universe expansion (might be a kind of field?)
- actual mechanics (e.g. higgs boson field, or what is actually causing interactions, or whether it even is good to envision matter as points (as opposed to strings))
- whether it is random or chaos (deterministic vs random debate)
- whether quantum bs is lowest energy state, which could allow vacuum decay and so on
- whether we are in a simulation or an equivalent of which
- how the universe came to be
- consciousness (and free will? (though free will is certainly not right)), and et. what happens after death and so on
- and a bunch more. But none of these need to be determined for our practical purposes. Proven via? (being able to simulate our lives with only the axioms given?)


B3 What to examine for humans?: Changes over time. Since humans may only notice differences by looking from a different point in spacetime, and that humans can only reach a different point in space with time, the passing of time is absolutely important. We will hence look for trajectories, first by setting them, and then identifying them within our scenario. //this goes into next one?


//the material world is important for humans, because humans are only material

//with the uf, we can then determine all trajectories of the universe, and then check which will dominate
